# pe-apptxn-core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanspa/pe-apptxn-core.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/evanspa/pe-apptxn-core)

A Clojure library encapsulating the server-side data model and data access functions of the
[PEAppTransaction Logging Framework](#peapptransaction-logging-framework).  [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com) is used as the underlying data store.

If you're looking for a REST interface,
[pe-apptxn-restsupport](https://github.com/evanspa/pe-apptxn-restsupport) exists
to provide a REST API on top of the functionality provided by pe-apptxn-core.

pe-apptxn-core is part of the
[pe-* Clojure Library Suite](#pe--clojure-library-suite).

## PEAppTransaction Logging Framework

The PEAppTransaction Logging Framework (PELF) provides a small set of functions to log what are termed "application transactions."  An application transaction is not a transaction in a database sense; it is meant more to model application-level actions.  For example, a user creating a new purchase order within your application would be termed as an application transaction.  A user signing in to your application would be an application transaction.  A user signing out, another.  

The PELF provides both client-side and server-side libraries.  PELF client-side libraries are used by applications to locally record application transactions and transaction events.  Transaction events are simply timestamped events associated with an application transaction.  E.g., if "create a purchase order" is an application transaction, a transaction event might be: "user clicks "New PO" button to initiate transaction."  Another event might be: "web service request initiated to submit new PO data to server".  And another: "web service response received".  All of this log data is saved locally on the client, and then later pushed to the server for permanent storage (and offline analysis).

### Motivation

The motivation behind the creation of the PEAppTransaction logging framework is
simple: to systematically track important events about the goings-on within an
application (*an end-user application or otherwise*).  You can use the framework
to record information about your application, such as:
+ How long a user takes to fill-out a form (or more generally, a call-to-action).
+ What the round-trip time is for making web service calls.
+ How often a user leaves a screen in your app without fulfilling the
call-to-action.

The set of use cases for which to use the framework to log metadata is
open-ended.  You can use it for basic A/B testing, tracking performance-related
metrics and many more.
